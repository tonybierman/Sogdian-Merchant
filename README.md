To increase variability in the Sogdian Merchant game, where the optimal strategy consistently chooses minimal guards, prefers Veteran/Novice guides predictably, and heavily favors Karachi Market, consider these targeted changes:

1. **Dynamic Market Attributes**: Introduce variability in market properties (Distance, BaseRisk, Profit) each round using random modifiers (e.g., ±10-20% based on random events like weather or trade disruptions). This makes market choice less predictable.

2. **Guard Effectiveness Variability**: Instead of a fixed 0.1 risk reduction per guard, use a random range (e.g., 0.05-0.15) influenced by guard quality or random events, encouraging varied guard allocations.

3. **Guide Performance Randomization**: Add random performance modifiers to guides (e.g., Novice might occasionally outperform Veteran, or guides could fail, reducing travel rate by 10-20%). This reduces reliance on Veteran when picking first.

4. **Camel Quality Impact**: Increase camel quality's influence on profit (e.g., scale profit by camel quality more significantly) and introduce rare events where poor camel quality drastically increases travel time, making "Do Nothing" occasionally viable.

5. **Market Availability Events**: Randomly make markets unavailable some rounds due to events (e.g., bandit raids, political unrest), forcing players to adapt to Bukhara or Jankent more often.

6. **Risk Tolerance Variation**: Adjust player and computer risk tolerance randomly each round (e.g., 0.3-0.7 instead of fixed 0.5), impacting market choice scores and diversifying outcomes.

7. **Resource Scarcity**: Introduce a small random chance (e.g., 5%) that no guards or guides are available, forcing strategic shifts toward safer or riskier markets.

These changes introduce randomness and strategic trade-offs, reducing the predictability of always choosing minimal guards and Karachi Market, while encouraging dynamic decision-making.
